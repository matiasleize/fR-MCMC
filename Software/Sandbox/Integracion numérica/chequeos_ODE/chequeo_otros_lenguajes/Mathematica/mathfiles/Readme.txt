The following files can be used to recreate all the results and Figs of the accompanying paper:
"Observational constraints on viable f(R) parametrizations with geometrical and dynamical probes"

1) "code_v1.3_wCDM_SnIa_CMB_BAO_growth.nb"
This file calculates the main results of the paper for the LCDM model.

2) "code_v1.3_f(R)_HS_SnIa_CMB_BAO_growth.nb"
This file calculates the main results of the paper for the Hu-Sawicki f(R) model.

3) "code_v1.3_f(R)_Starob_SnIa_CMB_BAO_growth.nb"
This file calculates the main results of the paper for the Starobinsky f(R) model.

4) "f(R)_theory_3_HS.nb"
This file calculates the "b" expansion for the Hu-Sawicki f(R) model and tests its accuracy.

5) "f(R)_theory_3_Starob.nb"
This file calculates the "b" expansion for the Starobinsky f(R) model and tests its accuracy.

6) ".\backups"
This folder contains some cached results. If you want to use these make sure you don't use the Export commands spread through out the .nb files or otherwise they might be overwritten.

7) ".\data"
This folder the various SnIa data. In the paper we used the Union 2.1. The other data used were the WMAP 9 CMB shift parameters, various BAO and growth rate data, see the paper for details.
