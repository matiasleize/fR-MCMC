Nominal SN and Cepheid-host Distances used in
  Pantheon+ arXiv:2202.04077
  SH0ES arXiv:2112.04510
are provided in Pantheon+SH0ES.dat

Statistical and Stat+Systematic Covariance matrices are provided in
Pantheon+SH0ES_STATONLY.cov
Pantheon+SH0ES_STAT+SYS.cov (all systematics)

Covariances for specific sources of systematics can be found in sytematic_groupings/

The format of the covariance (.cov) file is NxN lines where the matrix should be read in sequentially.  The first line gives the number of rows/columns in the matrix (N=1701).  The STATONLY matrix has only elements that correspond to the statistical distance uncertainties for individual SNe. This includes intrinsic scatter off-diagonal components when the light-curves represent the same SN observed by different surveys. The STAT+SYS matrix also includes all the covariance between SNe (and also Cepheid host covariance) due to systematic uncertainties.
